## Open House Matchmaker

### **Problem:**

Real estate agents often struggle to find the most effective open house hosts. Listing agents get too many volunteers (some unqualified), and open houses don’t always lead to leads or conversions.

### **Solution:**

Build an **AI Agent that automatically recommends the best open house host** for a listing based on:

* Past performance (conversion rate, feedback scores)
* Area familiarity (based on past listings, buyers represented)
* Schedule availability (integrated with calendar APIs)
* Buyer pool alignment (historical buyer interests & price points)

### **Features:**

* **Agent Scoring Engine:** Scores agents based on likelihood of success for the specific property.
* **Smart Scheduler:** Recommends top 3 agents and sends calendar invites.
* **Feedback Loop:** Updates model based on post-open house outcomes (e.g., did it lead to a sale or lead?).
* **Fair Rotation Logic:** Ensures newer agents also get opportunities to host (solve for cold start and bias).

### **Stack Suggestion:**

* **Frontend:** ExpressionEngine dashboard or lightweight React interface
* **Backend:** Python (FastAPI) with scikit-learn or XGBoost for scoring
* **Data:** MLS data + internal brokerage records
* **Calendar Integration:** Google Calendar or Outlook API
* **Agent Data Management:** Airtable or Postgres

### **Bonus:**

Offer an **email summary** or **Slack alert**: “This week’s top matches for open houses are ready.”
